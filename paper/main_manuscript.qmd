# Introduction

The reintroduction of wolves in the continental United States is often heralded as a conservation success story [Beggen 2019]. Wolves had been essentially eliminated in the lower 48 states by the mid-1900s, but the passage of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) paved the way for wolf reintroduction. In 1995 and 1996 wolves were translocated from Canada and released in Yellowstone National Park and the Sawtooth National Forest in Idaho. Over the proceeding decades wolf populations have risen, and this increase in population is matched with a rising contentiousness. The ranching community has been an outspoken voice challenging the conservation of wolves and their fraught position as an protected species. Ranchers cite the economic costs of wolf depredation on cattle as a cause for their concerns, yet current data shows that wolves only account for a very small minority of cattle loss. 

In 2017, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published a comprehensive report of all cattle and calf mortalities for the year 2015 [USDA 2017]. This publication details reported causes of predatory and non-predatory loss of cattle, including wolf depredation. Two years later, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) published a report relying heavily on the aforementioned USDA data The HSUS report clearly demonstrates that the amount of cattle lost to wolves is minuscule compared to other causes of death and the cattle population overall [HSUS 2019]. However, the study area included the entire United States, much of which has no wolf population, thus deflating the percentage of wolf depredations. The data used for the report was also from just one year and does not give an idea of how wolf depredation changes over time. 

If wolves are such a pressing economic issue for ranchers in the United States, why is there no place based longitudinal analysis of the issue? Are economic costs the true issue at hand, or are finances taking the blame for a deeper matter? 

In this study I conduct a longitudinal analysis of the relationship between wolf population, cattle population and wolf depredation in the Western United States. For the purpose of the research the "Western" United States will include: Washington, Oregon, Montana and Wyoming. All of these states have ranching operations and wolf populations that can trace their lineage to the original relocated wolves in the mid-90s.

# Data and Methods

The variables In question for this research are cattle population, cattle mortality, wolf population, and confirmed wolf kills for cattle. These variables are organized by state and year starting from 2012 and ending at 2022. I downloaded data on cattle population and mortality by state and year through the USDA Quickfacts database. 

I compiled the wolf data set myself by reading through annual wolf reports published by each state's respective Fish and Wildlife agency. I combed through annual reports and gleaned the wolf population per year and the number of cattle mortalities confirmed by the state to have been caused by wolves. The issue of reporting gets complicated across state lines and agencies. Some state reports have differing designations for "possible", "probable" and "confirmed" wolf kills. For the sake of consistency I only counted confirmed wolf kills for this report. In 2020 Wyoming changed it's reporting practices and lumped in injured and killed cattle into one value, so I opted to drop the wolf depredation values in Wyoming starting in 2020. Montana has not yet published their 2022 wolf report, so those values are unavailable in my data set. 

I originally intended to conduct this analysis with two additional states, Idaho and California. However, I encountered issues with a lack of data accessibility. Idaho has not published a wolf report for the public since 2016 and that is the only wolf report available on their Fish and Wildlife webpage. Without the help of a legal team I cannot pursue a FOIA request for that information so I made the tough decision to cut Idaho from this analysis, despite it's importance in wolf conservation and policy. California, on the other hand, publishes wolf reports quarterly that are difficult to glean yearlong information from. Given the difficulties of obtaining reliable annual information from Californian reports I made another tough decision to cut California from this report.
