# Introduction

The reintroduction of wolves in the continental United States is often heralded as a conservation success story [Beggen 2019]. Wolves had been essentially eliminated in the lower 48 states by the mid-1900s, but the passage of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) paved the way for wolf reintroduction. In 1995 and 1996 wolves were translocated from Canada and released in Yellowstone National Park and the Sawtooth National Forest in Idaho. Over the proceeding decades wolf populations have risen, and this increase in population is matched with a rising contentiousness. The ranching community has been an outspoken voice challenging the conservation of wolves and their fraught position as an protected species. Ranchers cite the economic costs of wolf depredation on cattle as a cause for their concerns, yet current data shows that wolves only account for a very small minority of cattle loss. 

In 2017, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published a comprehensive report of all cattle and calf mortalities for the year 2015 [USDA 2017]. This publication details reported causes of predatory and non-predatory loss of cattle, including wolf depredation. Two years later, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) published a report relying heavily on the aforementioned USDA data The HSUS report clearly demonstrates that the amount of cattle lost to wolves is minuscule compared to other causes of death and the cattle population overall [HSUS 2019]. However, the study area included the entire United States, much of which has no wolf population, thus deflating the percentage of wolf depredations. The data used for the report was also from just one year and does not give an idea of how wolf depredation changes over time. 

If wolves are such a pressing economic issue for ranchers in the United States, why is there no place based longitudinal analysis of the issue? Are economic costs the true issue at hand, or are finances taking the blame for a deeper matter? 

In this study I conduct a longitudinal analysis of the relationship between wolf population, cattle population and wolf depredation in the Western United States. For the purpose of the research the "Western" United States will include: Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. All of these states have ranching operations and wolf populations that can trace their lineage to the original relocated wolves in the mid-90s.
