This directory contains all raw data that is external to the project. The data in this folder contains information for wolf population, cattle population, cattle deaths and cattle deaths confirmed to be caused by wolf depredation. 

The Cattle Loss file and the Cattle Numbers files were downloaded from the USDA Quick stats directory: https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/

Both cattle files contain cattle numbers and losses for California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington from the year 2010-2022. The values salient for this research are Year (column B), State (column F), and Value (column T). 

The Wolf data file was compiled by myself. I read through several state wolf plans and gleaned pertinent information for this research-- namely the wolf population by year and the number of confirmed cattle losses to wolves per year. Because of issues with a lack of data I had to drop Idaho and California entirely. I also decided to limit my research to the years 2012-2022 because of a lack of data on wolf population before 2012. Missing values are indicated by an na. Montana has missing values for 2022 because their 2022 wolf report is not yet published. Wyoming is missing values in cattle kills since 2020 because of a reporting change from the state that does not differentiate between death and injury. Wyoming is also inexplicably missing data from 2016 and 2015. 

All of the information can be found in the following wolf annual reports:
